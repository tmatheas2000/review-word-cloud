Their gourmet cakes and cupcakes are beautifully decorated and tailored to the season. Their window decor is seasonal, lovely, and very creative. The owners clearly care about their business and it shows. This place is very popular and often has a line.',

            reviewText: 'This long time local bakery maintains its history of great taste and unusual combinations. I like their large chunk fig bread reminiscent of similar Parisian loaves. And the cherry chocolate bread doesn‚Äôt skimp on ingredients either with healthy bits of fruit and meltable chocolate nuggets that smell wonderful in the toaster. Another personal favorite is their seed coated caramelized onion bits baguettes which share their fragrance in the bag driving home and explodes with sweet aroma when toasted.',

            reviewText: 'Classic bakery but was slightly disappointed by the items we ordered. The turtle cheesecake was a bit too dense and also didn\'t really have much flavor. The quiche lorraine was just ""okay"" and seemed to be lacking in flavor. Though my husband loves quiches so we tried the same item in the West Portal outlet and it was absolutely delicious. What they did get right in both places was the crust on the quiche - it was buttery and just the right amount of flakiness. The one item I really did like though from this outlet was the lemon tart - it was just the right amount tart and they nailed the crust again. Based on the items that I tried, I would say that their breads and baked crusts are winners and I just need to try those the next time.',

My favorite cupcake was the Lemon Drop. My friend loved the Red Velvet. The 2nd time we got cookies... Pecan chocolate chip and oatmeal raisin. Soon Good!! The coffee there is nice too! I\'m allergic to eggs and dairy and am probably suffering from it right now... But totally worth it! LoL',

I only walked one block to the car, then drove a bit (with bag propped fully upright and secured so it didn\'t shift). Then walk another few blocks to the venue, and all the cupcakes were destroyed. The cupcakes just fell over because the cardboard holders were too low and the center of gravity is high due to the icing and such.  Not like some of the cupcakes.  Literally every cupcake was ruined. Delicious flavors but won\'t get the cupcakes to go again.',

After we contacted them, they said they left it outside our address instead, WHO DOES THAT IN SF, WITHOUT PREVIUOS NOTICE? So we never found the cake. The kids in the party were super sad about the missing cake :(We used to order cakes from here, but after this experience and after reading many bad experiences as mine in other comments, it seems that they are constantly having bad service so NEVER BUYING AGAIN.',

I said ""excuse me"" at least three times while waiting and finally caught the attention of the person who was servicing the other customer to which she replied ""I am busy and cannot help you"".

            reviewText: 'Turtle cheesecake: 1/5, only redeeming factor is the Oreo crust. The chocolate center is made with cloyingly sweet chocolate and the cheesecake is all the calories without any mouthfeel of creamy indulgence. Brownie: 3/5, nothing to write home about, better after it‚Äôs been in the freezer and becomes chewy. I prefer my homemade brownies. Small fruit tart: 2/5: this was most disappointing of all because there‚Äôs so much potential for a good fruit tart. The pastry dough used is rather flavorless without the authentic delicate, buttery profile I love in tart crusts. The cr√®me p√¢tissi√®re was dull as well. It‚Äôs infinitely easy to make good cr√®me p√¢tissi√®re, what‚Äôs the issue here? Seeded bread loaf: 4/5: this is very good execution. Even if I‚Äôm not that into pepitas, I think most people would enjoy this bread. I‚Äôll probably have to commute back to Thorough Bread and Pastry for real quality tarts. I‚Äôll keep testing NVB, though, and will report back if I find a cake or tart of high quality. You never know! Maybe I made all the wrong choices.',

They had no idea who I was, why I was there and what I wanted. It was not my fault. They did not even care.. They slipped missing pastry in my bag and glad to see me go...no sorry for forgetting, no here is an extra piece for our mistake. The shop was closed and the extras would be going in the bin.
